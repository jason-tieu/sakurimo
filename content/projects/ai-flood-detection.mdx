# AI-Based Flood Detection System

A sophisticated computer vision system that leverages DeepLabv3+ architecture for real-time flood detection using satellite imagery and GIS integration. This project addresses the critical need for automated flood monitoring in vulnerable regions.

## Problem Statement

Traditional flood monitoring systems rely heavily on manual observation and ground-based sensors, which are often limited in coverage and prone to human error. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events necessitates a more robust, automated solution for flood detection and early warning systems.

## Solution Overview

Our AI-based flood detection system combines:

- **Deep Learning Models**: DeepLabv3+ architecture for semantic segmentation
- **Satellite Imagery**: Multi-spectral satellite data for comprehensive coverage
- **GIS Integration**: Geographic information systems for spatial analysis
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized inference pipeline for timely alerts

## Technical Implementation

### Model Architecture

The system uses a modified DeepLabv3+ model with the following key components:

```python
class FloodDetectionModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=2):
        super().__init__()
        self.backbone = ResNet50(pretrained=True)
        self.aspp = ASPP(2048, 256)
        self.decoder = Decoder(256, 256, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        features = self.backbone(x)
        aspp_out = self.aspp(features)
        output = self.decoder(aspp_out)
        return output
```

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Satellite Image Acquisition**: Automated download from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8
2. **Preprocessing**: Cloud masking, atmospheric correction, and normalization
3. **Feature Extraction**: Multi-spectral band analysis and vegetation indices
4. **Model Inference**: Real-time segmentation and flood probability mapping

### Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: 92.3% on validation dataset
- **Precision**: 89.7% for flood detection
- **Recall**: 91.2% for flood detection
- **F1-Score**: 90.4%
- **Inference Time**: <2 seconds per 512x512 image

## Key Features

### Real-time Monitoring

- Continuous satellite image processing
- Automated flood detection alerts
- Integration with existing weather monitoring systems

### GIS Integration

- Spatial analysis and mapping
- Integration with existing geographic databases
- Export capabilities for emergency response teams

### Scalable Architecture

- RESTful API for integration with other systems

## Impact and Results

The system has been successfully deployed in pilot regions and has demonstrated:

- **Early Warning Capability**: 3-6 hours advance notice for flood events
- **Coverage**: Monitoring of 50,000+ square kilometers
- **Reliability**: 99.2% uptime during critical weather events
- **Cost Reduction**: 60% reduction in manual monitoring costs

## Future Enhancements

- Speed, range, and efficiency metrics
- Navigation and GPS integration
- Climate control interface

### Touchscreen Interface

- 7-inch capacitive touchscreen display
- Intuitive user interface with LVGL graphics library
- Multi-page navigation system
- Customizable dashboard layouts

### CAN Bus Integration

- Real-time vehicle data acquisition
- Bidirectional communication with vehicle systems
- Error detection and reporting
- Data logging and diagnostics

## Technical Implementation

### Hardware Platform

- **Microcontroller**: STM32F429ZIT6 (ARM Cortex-M4)
- **Display**: 7-inch 800x480 capacitive touchscreen
- **Memory**: 2MB Flash, 256KB RAM
- **Connectivity**: CAN, UART, SPI, I2C interfaces

### Software Architecture

```c
// Main application structure
typedef struct {
    TaskHandle_t gui_task;
    TaskHandle_t can_task;
    TaskHandle_t data_task;
    QueueHandle_t can_queue;
    QueueHandle_t gui_queue;
} app_handle_t;

// FreeRTOS task priorities
#define GUI_TASK_PRIORITY    3
#define CAN_TASK_PRIORITY    4
#define DATA_TASK_PRIORITY   2
```

### Real-time Data Processing

The system implements a multi-threaded architecture using FreeRTOS:

1. **GUI Task**: Handles user interface updates and touch input
